# *MultiFeatVotPIP*: A Tool for Predicting Pro-inflammatory Inducing Peptides

## Introduction

Peptides that induce pro-inflammatory cytokines are referred to as pro-inflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs), and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for alleviating and curing various diseases. The current biological analysis methods for identifying specific peptides present drawbacks, including time consumption, high costs, and challenges in high-throughput application. Hence, researchers tend to prefer sequence-based computational approaches to screen potential candidates before experimental verification to enhance efficiency and reduce costs.With the continual updating of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and further research, there is hope for more tools based on new technologies and methodologies to be developed, improving and enriching the capability to predict the pro-inflammatory response of inducing peptides. These new tools might integrate more bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms, leveraging large datasets for training and validation to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions.To address this, we have developed a new computational method that initially encodes the raw sequences into feature vectors, followed by predictions made through basic learning classifiers. The final prediction is then accomplished via a Voting ensemble learning strategy.
