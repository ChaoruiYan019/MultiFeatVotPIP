# *MultiFeatVotPIP*: A Tool for Predicting Pro-inflammatory Inducing Peptides

## Introduction

Inflammation represents the host tissues' or organs' response to detrimental stimuli, characterized by outcomes including functional impairment at the stimulation site [1], localized vasodilation, fever, among others [2]. Various factors, such as infections, trauma, and allergic reactions, can trigger inflammatory responses. Cytokines, a category of secretory proteins, facilitate intercellular communication and regulate key physiological processes, including immune responses, inflammation, and cell proliferation. Cytokines can be produced by a variety of cells, including immune cells, inflammatory cells, and other tissue cells. By acting on specific receptors, they influence the function and behavior of target cells [3]. Cytokines can be classified into pro-inflammatory signals—pro-inflammatory cytokines that promote the inflammatory response process, and anti-inflammatory signals—anti-inflammatory cytokines that inhibit the process [2]. The release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in response to tissue damage or infection, initiates an inflammatory response. These cytokines promote vasodilation, migration and activation of white blood cells, and the release of other inflammatory mediators, ultimately leading to the occurrence of inflammation. Ongoing research into inflammatory diseases has led researchers to categorize several conditions, including depression [4], obesity [5], heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease [6], as inflammatory in nature. In this context, an increasing number of scholars realize that studying the mechanisms of inflammation is crucial.

Peptides that induce pro-inflammatory cytokines are referred to as pro-inflammatory inducing peptides (PIPs), and are considered potential therapeutic candidates for alleviating and curing various diseases [7], [8]. The current biological analysis methods for identifying specific peptides present drawbacks, including time consumption, high costs, and challenges in high-throughput application. Hence, researchers tend to prefer sequence-based computational approaches to screen potential candidates before experimental verification to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. Tools for predicting the pro-inflammatory response of inducing peptides are limited, with only a few like the ProInflam method proposed by Sudheer Gupta, Midhun K. Madhu, et al. [7], the PIP-EL method by Balachandran Manavalan, Tae Hwan Shin, et al. [9], and the ProIn-Fuse method by Shamima Khatun, Mehedi Hasan, et al. [10] available. The ProInflam and ProIn-Fuse methods employ SVM and RF classifiers, respectively, for PIP prediction, while PIP-EL utilizes an ensemble learning strategy. With the continual updating of the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) [11] and further research, there is hope for more tools based on new technologies and methodologies to be developed, improving and enriching the capability to predict the pro-inflammatory response of inducing peptides. These new tools might integrate more bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms, leveraging large datasets for training and validation to enhance the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

To address this, we have developed a new computational method that initially encodes the raw sequences into feature vectors, followed by predictions made through basic learning classifiers. The final prediction is then accomplished via a Voting ensemble learning strategy. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels in several key aspects.
